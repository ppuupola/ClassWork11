            <h1>THE VOICE OF THE DEVIL</h1>
            <p>All Bibles or sacred codes have been the cause of the following errors:—</p>

           <ol>
               <li>That man has two real existing principles, viz., a Body and a Soul.</li>
               <li>That Energy, called Evil, is alone from the Body; and that Reason, called Good, is alone from the Soul.</li>
               <li>That God will torment man in Eternity for following his Energies.</li>
           </ol>
           <p>But the following contraries to these are true:—</p>
           <ol>
            <li>Man has no Body distinct from his Soul. For that called Body is a portion of Soul discerned by the five senses, the chief inlets of Soul in this age.</li>
            <li>Energy is the only life, and is from the Body; and Reason is the bound or outward circumference of Energy.</li>
            <li>Energy is Eternal Delight.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Those who restrain desire, do so because theirs is weak enough to be restrained; and the restrainer or reason usurps its place and governs the unwilling.
            And being restrained, it by degrees becomes passive, till it is only the shadow of desire.
            The history of this is written in Paradise Lost, and the Governor or Reason is called Messiah.
            And the original Archangel or possessor of the command of the heavenly host is called the Devil, or Satan, and his children are called Sin and Death.
            But in the book of Job, Milton’s Messiah is called Satan.
            For this history has been adopted by both parties.
            It indeed appeared to Reason as if[10] desire was cast out, but the Devil’s account is, that the Messiah fell, and formed a heaven of what he stole from the abyss.
            This is shown in the Gospel, where he prays to the Father to send the Comforter or desire that Reason may have ideas to build on, the Jehovah of the Bible being no other than he who dwells in flaming fire. Know that after Christ’s death he became Jehovah.
            But in Milton, the Father is Destiny, the Son a ratio of the five senses, and the Holy Ghost vacuum!
