            <h1>A SONG OF LIBERTY</h1>

           <ol>
               <li>The Eternal Female groan’d; it was heard over all the earth:</li>
               <li>Albion’s coast is sick silent; the American meadows faint.</li>
               <li>Shadows of prophecy shiver along by the lakes and the rivers, and mutter across the ocean. France, rend down thy dungeon!</li>
               <li>Golden Spain, burst the barriers of old Rome!</li>
               <li>Cast thy keys, O Rome, into the deep—down falling, even to eternity down falling;</li>
               <li>And weep!</li>
               <li>In her trembling hands she took the new-born terror, howling.</li>
               <li>On those infinite mountains of light now barr’d out by the Atlantic sea, the new-born fire stood before the starry king.</li>
               <li>Flagg’d with grey-brow’d snows and thunderous visages, the jealous wings wav’d over the deep.</li>
               <li>The speary hand burn’d aloft; unbuckled was the shield; forth went the hand of jealousy among the flaming hair, and hurl’d the new-born wonder through the starry night.</li>
               <li>The fire, the fire is falling!</li>
               <li>Look up! look up! O citizen of London, enlarge thy countenance! O Jew, leave counting gold; return to thy oil and wine! O African, black African! (Go, winged thought, widen his forehead.)</li>
               <li>The fiery limbs, the flaming hair shot like the sinking sun into the Western sea.</li>
               <li>. Wak’d from his eternal sleep, the hoary element roaring fled away.
                [45]
                </li>
               <li>Down rush’d, beating his wings in vain, the jealous king, his grey-brow’d councillors, thunderous warriors, curl’d veterans, among helms and shields, and chariots, horses, elephants, banners, castles, slings, and rocks.</li>
               <li>Falling, rushing, ruining; buried in the ruins, on Urthona’s dens.</li>
               <li>With thunder and fire, leading his starry hosts through the waste wilderness, he promulgates his ten commandments, glancing his beamy eyelids over the deep in dark dismay.</li>
               <li>Where the Son of Fire in his Eastern cloud, while the Morning plumes her golden breast</li>
               <li>Spurning the clouds written with curses, stamps the stony law to dust, loosing the eternal horses from the dens of night, crying: “Empire is no more! and now the lion and wolf shall cease.”</li>
               
           </ol>
