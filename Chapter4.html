            <h1>PROVERBS OF HELL</h1>
            <p>
                In seed-time learn, in harvest teach, in winter enjoy. <br/>
Drive your cart and your plough over the bones of the dead.<br/>
The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.<br/>
Prudence is a rich ugly old maid courted by Incapacity.<br/>
He who desires, but acts not, breeds pestilence.<br/>
The cut worm forgives the plough.<br/>
Dip him in the river who loves water.<br/>
A fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees.<br/>
He whose face gives no light shall never become a star.<br/>
Eternity is in love with the productions of time.<br/>
The busy bee has no time for sorrow.<br/>
The hours of folly are measured by the clock, but of wisdom no clock can measure.<br/>
All wholesome food is caught without a net or a trap.<br/>
Bring out number, weight, and measure in a year of dearth.<br/>
No bird soars too high if he soars with his own wings.<br/>
A dead body revenges not injuries.<br/>
The most sublime act is to set another before you.<br/> 
If the fool would persist in his folly he would become wise.<br/>
Folly is the cloak of knavery.<br/>
Shame is Pride’s cloak.<br/>
Prisons are built with stones of law, brothels with bricks of religion.<br/>
The pride of the peacock is the glory of God.<br/>
The lust of the goat is the bounty of God.<br/>
The wrath of the lion is the wisdom of God.<br/>
The nakedness of woman is the work of God.<br/>
Excess of sorrow laughs, excess of joy weeps.<br/>
The roaring of lions, the howling of wolves, the raging of the stormy sea, and the destructive sword, are portions of Eternity too great for the eye of man.<br/>
The fox condemns the trap, not himself.<br/>
Joys impregnate, sorrows bring forth.<br/>
Let man wear the fell of the lion, woman the fleece of the sheep.<br/>
The bird a nest, the spider a web, man friendship.<br/>
The selfish smiling fool and the sullen frowning fool shall be both thought wise that they may be a rod.<br/>
What is now proved was once only imagined.<br/>
The rat, the mouse, the fox, the rabbit watch the roots; the lion, the tiger, the horse, the elephant watch the fruits.<br/>
The cistern contains, the fountain overflows.<br/>
One thought fills immensity.<br/>
Always be ready to speak your mind, and a base man will avoid you.<br/>
Everything possible to be believed is an image of truth.<br/>
The eagle never lost so much time as when he submitted to learn of the crow.<br/>
The fox provides for himself, but God provides for the lion.<br/>
Think in the morning, act in the noon, eat in the evening, sleep in the night.<br/>
He who has suffered you to impose on him knows you.<br/>
As the plough follows words, so God rewards prayers.<br/>
The tigers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction.<br/>
Expect poison from the standing water.<br/>
You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough.<br/>
Listen to the fool’s reproach; it is a kingly title.<br/>
The eyes of fire, the nostrils of air, the mouth of water, the beard of earth.<br/>
The weak in courage is strong in cunning.<br/>
The apple tree never asks the beech how he shall grow, nor the lion the horse how he shall take his prey.<br/>
The thankful receiver bears a plentiful harvest.<br/>
If others had not been foolish we should have been so.<br/>
The soul of sweet delight can never be defiled.<br/>
When thou seest an eagle, thou seest a portion of Genius. Lift up thy head!<br/>
As the caterpillar chooses the fairest leaves to lay her eggs on, so the priest lays his curse on the fairest joys.<br/>
To create a little flower is the labour of ages.<br/>
[19]<br/>
Damn braces; bless relaxes.<br/>
The best wine is the oldest, the best water the newest.<br/>
Prayers plough not; praises reap not; joys laugh not; sorrows weep not.<br/>
The head Sublime, the heart Pathos, the genitals Beauty, the hands and feet Proportion.<br/>
As the air to a bird, or the sea to a fish, so is contempt to the contemptible.<br/>
The crow wished everything was black; the owl that everything was white.<br/>
Exuberance is Beauty.<br/>
If the lion was advised by the fox, he would be cunning.<br/>
Improvement makes straight roads, but the crooked roads without Improvement are roads of Genius.<br/>
Sooner murder an infant in its cradle than nurse unacted desires.<br/>
Where man is not, nature is barren.<br/>
Truth can never be told so as to be understood and not to be believed.<br/>
Enough! or Too much.<br/>
